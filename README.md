# Welcome To ForgedInFrontier!
An expansion pack that adds **20+ Quality Moons** and **8 Unique Interiors**, Balanced and Configured for ***ForgedInFatality***, a Challenging yet Balanced Modpack designed to __Test Your Mortality!__

This expansion was crafted to create the perfect blend between the most vanilla-friendly Moons and Interiors, carefully marrying each moon with the perfect interior to complement it. 
Each interior has already been balanced so no need to worry about having an infinite maze with no scrap in sight.
### **Don't worry, you can use this Modpack addon with ANY Modpack as I've included everything needed for it to be added to other packs, LMK if you'd like to include it in yours!**

Thanks to Wesley, Tolian, SfDesat, and AudioKnight for all their beautiful work and the fantastic help and feedback they gave me on balancing the interiors on each of their moons.
