# [RELEASE!!!] <ins>Welcome To ForgedInFrontier!</ins>
### [1.0.0] [For LC v49] An expansion pack that adds **20+ Quality Moons** and **8 Unique Interiors**, Balanced and Configured for ***ForgedInFatality***, a Challenging yet Balanced Modpack designed to <ins>Test Your Mortality!</ins>

Each interior has already been balanced so no need to worry about having an infinite maze with no scrap in sight.
