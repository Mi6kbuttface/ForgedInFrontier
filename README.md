# NOTICE!!! DISABLE LETHALLEVELLOADER
As of right now, the current version of LLL has MANY issues that can cause desyncs and interior problems across hosts and clients, to fix this, a fork has been created called LethalLevelLoaderFixed and will act as a substitute until otherwise needed.

## <ins>💎 Scarlet Devil Mansion 💎 (*Alice*) 💎</ins>

**The Mental Hospital is a psychiatric institution, designed to treat and cure even the most insane of employees.
