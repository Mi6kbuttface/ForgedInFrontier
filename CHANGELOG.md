# CHANGELOG

# v1.0.0
***Modpack Full Release! Includes 22 Moons and 8 Interiors.***

## New Interior 
- Added Sector-0 by Rosiepie
  - Sector-0 was a classified Company bioweapon containment zone, only Authorized Assets may be debriefed. An evacuation-level event occurred in the Biolabs, resulting from multiple containment breaches, causing the immediate evacuation and abandonment of all Sector-0 facilities; it is advised that you do not investigate further. Your death will not be insured.
